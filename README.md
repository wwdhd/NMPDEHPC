The WENO Schemes has not been successfully executed. There are errors generated in the F1 scheme, creating far different results to the analytical.
For efficiency, the codes for parallel code are simplified, thus generates less time overall compared to the serial codes and create more efficiency in transfering data from personal to the HPC facility. This is done by deleting the norms calculation, dividing into different files for every schemes, etc.
